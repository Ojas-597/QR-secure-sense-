# 🔐 QR Secure Sense  
### A QR-Based Cyber Awareness & Fake-Malware Demonstration System

QR Secure Sense is an interactive cybersecurity awareness project designed for exhibitions, colleges, and workshops.  
It simulates how attackers can use **malicious QR codes** to deceive users — and then teaches visitors how to stay safe.

The system shows a **fake malware alert** after scanning a QR code (purely simulated and safe), then guides users through:
- Device safety check
- Awareness learning
- A short quiz
- Steps to “remove” the fake malware  
- Security best practices

This project is 100% safe, contains no harmful code, and is intended **only for education & awareness**.

##  Features

### **1. QR Scan Simulation**
Visitors scan a QR code → are taken to a dynamic “malware detected” simulation page.

### **2. Fake Malware Demonstration (SAFE)**
Shows how attackers deceive users:
- Fake warnings  
- Fake permissions  
- Fake download alerts  

No real malware is used.

### **3. Device Self-Assessment**
The app guides the visitor to:
- Check app permissions  
- Check unknown app installs  
- Review network safety  
- Identify suspicious behaviours  

### **4. Malware Removal Simulation**
A “Cleanup Wizard” explains:
- What a real malware would do  
- How to detect it  
- How to remove it  
- How to harden the device  

### **5. Awareness Learning + Quiz**
Includes:
- Short cyber safety lessons  
- MCQ quiz (options A, B, C, D)
- Score evaluation  
- Awareness certificate text (optional)

### **6. Admin Dashboard**
Protected login for exhibitors:
- Generate QR codes  
- View scan events  
- Reset demo  
- Manage awareness questions

## 🏗️ Project Structure

QR Secure Sense — Demo Handout
------------------------------
Purpose
- Educate users about QR risks: social engineering via QR codes.
- Demonstrate how QR codes can point to malicious content and show safe remediation steps.

What visitors will see
1. A printed QR code on the demo booth (clearly labelled "Educational demo — consent required")
2. On scan: a consent page → a fake malware simulation (UI-only) showing symptoms
3. A remediation wizard and short quiz
4. Anonymous feedback survey

Key messages to communicate
- Never scan unknown QR codes without verifying context.
- Do not install apps or follow instructions from suspicious pages.
- Keep OS and apps updated; contact official IT if you suspect real compromise.

Safety & Ethics
- Simulation is harmless: no downloads, no commands, no passwords requested.
- All collected data is anonymous; survey optional.
- Ask for institutional approval before public demos.

Demo instructions for staff
- Print QR pointing to: https://<your-demo-url>/fake-malware
- Add signage: "Educational Demo — Consent Required"
- If a visitor is concerned their device is actually affected, instruct them to contact campus IT.
