# 🔐 QR Secure Sense  
### A QR-Based Cyber Awareness & Fake-Malware Demonstration System

QR Secure Sense is an interactive cybersecurity awareness project designed for exhibitions, colleges, and workshops.  
It simulates how attackers can use **malicious QR codes** to deceive users — and then teaches visitors how to stay safe.

The system shows a **fake malware alert** after scanning a QR code (purely simulated and safe), then guides users through:
- Device safety check
- Awareness learning
- A short quiz
- Steps to “remove” the fake malware  
- Security best practices

This project is 100% safe, contains no harmful code, and is intended **only for education & awareness**.
